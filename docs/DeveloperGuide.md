## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes 
[`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and 
[`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in 
charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

**API:** [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/> 

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `IngredientListPanel`, 
`RecipeListPanel` `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class 
which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the 
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) 
is specified in 
[`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Inventory` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model Component

**API**: [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the Model Component"/>

The `Model` stores `Ingredient` and `Recipe`, the main components of this product. It provides the API to interact with
the available list of `Ingredient` and `Recipe`.

The `Model` component,

- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
- stores the `Inventory` data.
- stores the `Recipe Book` data.
- exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Ingredient>`, `ObservableList<Recipe>` that can be 'observed' by the UI.
- does not depend on the other three components

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage Component

**API**: [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the Storage Component"/>

The `Storage` manages the saving and reading of currently available `Ingredient` and `Recipe` to local storage.
It allows users to use the product as-is throughout different sessions.

The `Storage` component,

- consists of an Inventory Storage and Recipe Book Storage sub-component.
- saves the `UserPref` object in json format and read it back.
- saves the `Inventory` object in json format and read it back.
- saves the `RecipeBook` object in json format and read it back.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Search ingredient feature
#### Implementation
The search ingredient mechanism is implemented as a `Command`, extending from the `Command` abstract class.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search ingredient mechanism behaves at each step. The applicacation
is assumed to be initialised with at least one ingredient loaded in the `ModelManager`.

Step 1. The user keys in `stock Flour` into the UI command box. `LogicManager` takes this string command and executes it.

Step 2. `InventoryAppParser` is then called to parse the `stock Flour` command.

Step 3. `StockCommandParser` is then called to handle the parsing. The `parse(String args)` function is called with
the argument `"Flour"`.

Step 4. `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` predicate object is created which returns true for any ingredients tested on
the predicate with a name containing the phrase `"Flour"`. This step is case-insensitive.

Step 5. The `StockCommand` then filters the inventory in `ModelManager` according to the predicate.

Step 6. The `MainWindow` in the `ui` detects that there are some items in the filtered inventory, and proceeds to
display ingredients satisfying the predicate

`StockCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredIngredientList(Predicate<Ingredient> predicate)`, filtering the
ingredient list in `ModelManager` according to the predicate set.

#### Alternatives considered:
An alternative implementation of the stock command would be to find the ingredient that matches the query perfectly,
resulting in either 0 or 1 ingredients are filtering. Each ingredient should have a unique name, hence an ingredient with
any name can either only be stored in the inventory or not, and therefore the search result will be more specific, and
potentially more convenient to use.

However, we expect users to have multiple ingredients with a common word, as natural language tends to group items of a
similar nature in the same group of phrases (eg. eggs and duck eggs). Hence, we have decided that searching for items
whose name contains the phrase of the query is more suitable for home bakers, considering the number of repeated phrases
and expressions commonly used in baking.

### Add recipe feature
#### Implementation
The add recipe mechanism is implemented as a `Command`, extending from the `Command` abstract class.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add recipe mechanism behaves at each st ep.

Step 1. The user keys in the following command structure. `LogicManager` takes this string command and executes it.

```
addrecipe n/NAME
ingredients start
Flour 100g
Water 50g
⋮
steps start
1. STEP 1
2. STEP 2
⋮
steps end
```

Step 2. `InventoryAppParser` is then called to parse the command.

Step 3. By Polymorphism, `RecipeAddCommandParser` is called to handle the parsing. The parse(String args) function is
called.

Step 4. The name of the recipe is parsed out.

Step 5. The lines in the string body are grouped into a list of ingredient strings and step strings, by looking for the
`ingredient start` and `ingredient end` lines, as well as the `steps start` and `done` lines.

Step 6. The list of ingredient strings is parsed using the `parseRecipeIngredient()` method in the `Ingredient`.
This parser is more rigid than the ingredient parser used in the `AddCommandParser`, but does not require the `n/`, `q/` and `u/` tokens.

Step 7. The list of step strings is parsed into a `List<RecipeStep>` using the `parseRecipeStep()` method from the `RecipeStep` class.

Step 8. A new `Recipe` instance is created using the `Name`, `List<Ingredient>` and `List<RecipeStep>`.

Step 9. The `RecipeAddCommand` adds the new `Recipe` instance to the recipe list in `ModelManager`.

#### Alternatives considered:

An alternative implementation of the recipe add command would be to only specify the name, and add the ingredient and step lists 
later using recipe modifying commands. This would reduce the size of the command, leading to lower chances of user input error.

However, modifying the recipe through commands may be more slow than typing everything at once, since more command words need to be 
used. Furthermore, when inputting a recipe, users are likely to copy and paste the ingredient list and steps from another source.
As such, errors in input should be unlikely. It is also easy to see where an error may be in the input, since the format is
very readable, with little tokens and command words.

### View recipe feature
#### Implementation
The view recipe mechanism is implemented as a `Command`, extending from the `Command` abstract class.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view recipe mechanism behaves at each step. The application is
assumed to be initialised with at least one recipe loaded in the `ModelManager`.

Step 1. The user keys in `view 1` into the UI command box. `LogicManager` takes this string command and executes it.

Step 2. `InventoryAppParser` is then called to parse the `view 1` command.

Step 3. By Polymorphism, `RecipeViewCommandParser` is called on to handle the parsing. The `parse(String args)` function
is called with the argument of `"1"`

Step 4. A `RecipeUuidMatchesPredicate` object is created which returns true for any recipe tested on the
predicate with the same unique identifier (UUID) of `1`.

Step 5. The `RecipeViewCommand` then filters the recipe list in `ModelManager` according to the predicate. The recipe
list should only have at most 1 item after filtration.

Step 6. If there is a recipe with the same UUID inputted by the user in the recipe book, the `MainWindow` in `ui` will
detect that there is one item in the recipe list, and proceed to display the full recipe.

`RecipeViewCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredRecipeList(Predicate<Recipe> predicate)`, filtering the
recipe list in `ModelManager` according to the predicate set.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view recipe operation works:

<img src="images/UML/viewrecipesequencediagram.png" width="700">

**Note**: If the argument is an invalid UUID (less than or equals to 0), a
`ParseException` will be thrown and users will be informed that the UUID provided is invalid.

**Note**: If the recipe with that UUID does not exist in the app, a `CommandException` will be thrown and users will be
informed that there is no recipe with that UUID in the recipe book.

**Note**: The lifeline for `RecipeViewCommandParser` and `RecipeViewCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but 
due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

#### Alternatives considered:
An alternative implementation considered is to find the first recipe with UUID that matches instead of filtering through
the whole recipe list. Each recipe has a unique id, and hence the first instance of a recipe with match UUID should be 
the only recipe with that UUID. This could lead to faster search times to view a specific recipe.

However, we do not expect a user to have so many recipes that performance would become an issue. We do not expect
users to be frequently using this command either, since baking something requires much time and effort. Filtering
through the whole list also confers an advantage of being able to assert that there is at most one such recipe
with that particular UUID.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### List recipe feature
#### Implementation
The List feature is implemented as a type of `Command`. It extends the abstract class `Command`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list feature behaves at each step. The recipe storage is assumed to
be initialised with at least 2 recipes within `ModelManager`.

Step 1. The user launches the application. All recipes will be shown as the current recipeList has not been filtered.

Step 2. The user executes `view 1`. The `view` command will then update the recipeList to only contain the filtered
recipe.

Step 3. The user then executes `list`. The `list` command will be parsed using the `Inventory App Parser` within
`LogicManager`.

Step 4. This parsed command will be executed once again with `LogicManager`.

Step 5. During execution, `ModelManager#updateFilteredRecipeList` will be called with the `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECIPES`
to update the current recipeList with all the recipes.

Step 6. After execution, the returned `CommandResult` will then be returned back to the `MainWindow` to be displayed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list recipe feature works:

<img src="images/UML/listrecipesequencediagram.png" width="700">

#### Design Considerations:
**Aspect : How view executes:**
- Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Gets the list from the "RecipeBook"
  - Pro: Easy to implement
  - Con: Need to constantly store current state
- Alternative 2: Read the list from the storage
  - Pro: No need to store current state after command
  - Con: Need to access storage


### Search recipe feature
#### Implementation
The search recipe mechanism is implemented as a `Command`, extending from the `Command` abstract class.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search feature behaves at each step. For this scenario, it is assumed
that at least one recipe is loaded into `ModelManager`

Step 1. The user launches the application. All recipes will be shown as the current recipeList has not been filtered.

Step 2. The user executes `search flour`. The `search` command will be parsed using the `Inventory App Parser` within
`LogicManager`.

Step 3. By Polymorphism, `SearchCommandParser` is called on to handle the parsing. The `parse(String args)` function
is called with the argument of `"flour"`.

Step 4. A `RecipeIngredientNameMatchesPredicate` will be with the argument `"flour"` as its parameter.

Step 5. The `SearchCommand` then filters the recipe list in `ModelManager` according to the predicate. The recipe
list will display all recipes that require `"flour"`.

Step 6. After execution, the returned `CommandResult` will then be returned back to the `MainWindow` to be displayed.

`SearchCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredRecipeList(Predicate<Recipe> predicate)`, filtering the
recipe list in `ModelManager` according to the predicate set.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list recipe feature works:

<img src="images/UML/searchrecipesequencediagram.png" width="700">

### Delete recipe feature
#### Implementation
The delete recipe mechanism is implemented as a `Command`, extending from the `Command` abstract class.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete recipe mechanism behaves at each step. The application is
assumed to be initialised with at least one recipe loaded in the `ModelManager`.

Step 1. The user keys in `delete 1` into the UI command box. `LogicManager` takes this string command and executes it.

Step 2. `InventoryAppParser` is then called to parse the `delete 1` command.

Step 3. By Polymorphism, `DeleteCommandParser` is called on to handle the parsing. The `parse(String args)` function is 
called with the argument of "1" and the "1" is parsed as an `Integer`. This integer is then wrapped in a `UniqueId` constructor.

Step 4: A `DeleteCommand` object is then created with the `UniqueId` created passed in as a parameter.

Step 5: This `DeleteCommand` object is then executed. During execution, the recipe whose UUID matches with the `UniqueId` 
passed into the `DeleteCommand` is retrieved from the recipe list through the `Model#getRecipe(UniqueId uuid)` and the 
`Model#deleteRecipe(Recipe recipe)` will be called with this recipe, causing the recipe to be deleted from the recipe list.

**Note**: If the argument is an invalid UUID (less than or equals to 0), a 
`ParseException` will be thrown and users will be informed that the UUID provided is invalid.

**Note**: If the recipe with that UUID does not exist in the app, a `CommandException` will be thrown and users will be 
informed that there is no recipe with that UUID in the recipe book.

The following sequence diagram shows how the DeleteCommand works:
<img src="images/UML/deletesequencediagram.png" width="700px">

**Note**: In the diagram, `uuid` is the `UniqueId` that was passed into the `DeleteCommand` object.

**Note**: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, 
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


### Modify recipe feature
#### Implementation
The modify recipe mechanism is implemented as a `Command`, extending from the `Command` abstract class.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the modify recipe mechanism behaves at each step. The application is 
assumed to be initialised with at least one recipe loaded in the `ModelManager`.

Step 1. The user keys in `modify i/1 n/Milk q/100 u/g` into the UI command box. `LogicManager` takes this string command 
and executes it.

Step 2. `InventoryAppParser` is then called to parse the `modify i/1 n/Milk q/100 u/g` command.

Step 3. By Polymorphism, `ModifyCommandParser` is called on to handle the parsing. The `parse(String args)` function is
called with the argument of "i/1 n/Milk q/100 u/g" and this is then tokenized into the UUID of the recipe that will be modified, 
the modified ingredient's name, amount and unit. An `Ingredient` is created with this name and quantity (which consists 
of the amount and unit) specified. 

Step 4: A `ModifyCommand` object is then created with two parameters passed in - the UUID specified 
earlier wrapped in a `UniqueId` constructor as well as the `Ingredient`created earlier.

Step 5: This `ModifyCommand` object is then executed. During execution, the recipe whose UUID matches with the `UniqueId`
passed into the `ModifyCommand` is retrieved from the recipe list through the `Model#getRecipe(UniqueId uuid)`. This is the old recipe
before the ingredients are modified.

Step 6: During execution, there are 2 possibilities. 

If the recipe already contains the ingredient that was specified,
the `Recipe#modifyIngredients(String oldIngredient, Ingredient newIngredient)` will be called with the
name of the ingredient that is to be modified as well as the `Ingredient` that was passed into `ModifyCommand` such that 
the amount and unit of the ingredient can be modified. 

If the recipe does not already contain the ingredient that was specified, the `Recipe#addIngredient(Ingredient ingredient)` 
will be called with the `Ingredient` that was passed into `ModifyCommand` such that the ingredient is added to the 
ingredient list of that recipe. 

In both cases, this results in the creation of a new recipe with a modified ingredient list.

Step 7: Then the `Model#deleteRecipe(Recipe recipe)` is called on the old recipe that had the ingredient list before 
it was modified. 

Step 8: Then the `Model#addRecipe(Recipe recipe)` is called on the new recipe that has the modified ingredient list.

Step 9: `ModifyCommand` then calls `Model#updateFilteredRecipeList(Predicate<Recipe> predicate)`, filtering the
recipe list in `ModelManager` with a `RecipeUuidMatchesPredicate` that matches the `UniqueId` that was passed into 
`ModifyCommand`.

**Note**: If an invalid UUID (less than or equals to 0) is inputted, a
`ParseException` will be thrown and users will be informed that the UUID provided is invalid.

**Note**: If the recipe with that UUID does not exist in the app, a `CommandException` will be thrown and users will be
informed that there is no recipe with that UUID in the recipe book.

The following sequence diagram shows how the modify recipe feature works:

<img src="images/UML/modifysequencediagram.png" width="700px">

**Note**: The lifeline for `ModifyCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


**Note**: Due to limited space in the sequence diagram, certain behaviour could not be shown.
1. `recipeUuid` is the `UniqueId` of the recipe that was passed into `ModifyCommand`. 
2. `newRecipe` is the modified version of the recipe that contains the modified list of ingredients. This recipe was 
created with interaction with `Recipe` as mentioned in Step 6 above. 
3. `predicate` is the `RecipeUuidMatchesPredicate` that matches the `UniqueId` that was passed into `ModifyCommand`.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
#### 1. Recycling of UUIDs after deleting recipes
   Currently, the UUIDs for the recipes are unique across deleted and non deleted recipes. As such, when deleting a recipe, the corresponding UUID will no longer
   be available. For example, if there are recipes with the UUIDs 1, 2 and 3 and recipe with UUID 2 gets deleted, then the 
   next recipe added will have a UUID of 4 instead of 2 as 2 is no longer in use. We plan to make it such that when a recipe
   gets deleted, the next recipe added will take on this UUID to ensure that the UUID does not end up getting too large.

#### 2. Ensuring at least one ingredient in a recipe
   When inputting the ingredients during the addrecipe commands, users are able to entirely skip this portion by just typing
   steps start. This however is unrealistic as no recipe would require no ingredients to make. We plan to add a sanity check
   to ensure that at least one ingredient is inserted into the recipe.

#### 3. Ensuring at least one step in a recipe
   As a continuation from enhancement 2, addrecipe is also able to execute successfully without inputting any steps. We plan to make it such that
   users have to input at least one step.

#### 4. Checking only one ingredient inserted
   When adding ingredients to a recipe during the addrecipe command, there is no check to ensure that only one ingredient is
   being inputted at any point in time. As such, inputs such as `flour 100g milk 100g` would be parsed as `name: flour 100g milk`,
   `quantity: 100` `unit: g`. We plan to add a check that would ensure only one ingredient can be inputted at one time.
   So `flour 100g` would work but `flour 100g milk 100g` would return an error message.

#### 5. Allowing for use of default unit
   When using ingredients, either both unit and quantity must be inputted or neither must be present. However, it would be
   more efficient if we could just use input the quantity and use based on the unit of the ingredient. We plan to add a way
   to input only the name and quantity without the units to be more intuitive. For example: `use n/flour q/100` will not
   show an error but rather, consume 100 of whatever unit that flour is currently stored in.

#### 6. Checking for recipe step
   When adding recipe steps during the addrecipe command, the numbering of the steps is entirely dependent on the user and users
   can input in the wrong order such as `1 4 5`. We plan to add a check where users need  not type in the step number and the application will
   automatically generate the step index as per the order of steps inputted.

#### 7. Modifying the steps of a recipe
   Currently, the modify function only allows users to modify the ingredients in the recipe. However, it may be useful for users
   to be able to modify the steps of the recipe as well, especially if they want to add on to the ingredients in the list to
   modify the recipe.

## **Appendix: Effort**
- Significant effort went into refactoring the entire code base to change the AddressBook entities into ingredients and recipes.
- The recipe model and ingredient model were not trivial to design.
  - Much consideration was given to the design of the system representing the different units of an ingredient and the conversion between them.
  - The recipe model and how to build a recipe is also complex, since a recipe composes of many steps and ingredients.
  - Compared to AB3, our application manages more entities and has entities of greater complexity.
- The above also meant the add recipe and modify recipe feature were not easy to implement, and were very bug prone which took
effort to fix.
- The UI design took a significant effort, a mockup design was first done on figma to test the color combinations and layouts.
  - Figuring out how to change the view from a recipe list to a full recipe view was not simple, how javafx updates its 
UI components is not explained or easily understood through the UI code.
  - The UI is also made to be size responsive, the layout will retain its integrity even if the app is viewed in full-screen.
