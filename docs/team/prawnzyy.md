Project: [Ba]king [Br]ead

[Ba]king [Br]ead is a desktop inventory and recipe book management application that allows users to add ingredients and view
recipes. The user interacts with it through a CLI. The GUI is implemented using JavaFX and the project is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature:** Search for recipes using a specific ingredient
  - What it does: Allows the user to look for all recipes that require that specific ingredient to make.
  - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can search for recipes that make use of a 
  specific ingredient that they want to use instead of having to scroll through the whole recipe list.
- **New Feature:** List out all recipes
  - What it does : Displays all the recipes currently stored within the application.
- **Enhancement Implemented:** Adding a second window for recipe list
  - Justification: As users, we would like to be able to view both the ingredients and the recipe at the same time. Dividing 
    the screen into two separate windows allows us to view them separately.
